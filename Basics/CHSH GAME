CHSH Game – Complete Notes & Analysis

This folder contains my complete notes and code on the **CHSH Game**, as part of my work through IBM’s [Basics of Quantum Information](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/basics-of-quantum-information) course.

The CHSH game is a foundational concept in quantum information theory, used to demonstrate quantum nonlocality and violations of Bell inequalities using entangled states. It plays a central role in understanding how quantum strategies outperform classical strategies.


## 📘 Overview

### 1. Introduction

- Named after **Clauser, Horne, Shimony, Holt (1969)**.
- A nonlocal game showing the measurable advantage of **quantum entanglement**.
- Used as a concrete test of **Bell’s theorem**.



### 2. Nonlocal Games – General Structure

- **Players**: Alice and Bob, no communication during the game.
- **Referee**: Sends questions `x`, `y` ∈ {0,1} to Alice and Bob.
- **Answers**: Alice gives `a`, Bob gives `b` ∈ {0,1}.
- **Winning Rule**: Players win if `a ⊕ b = x ∧ y`.

### 3. CHSH Game Specification

- **Inputs/Outputs**: x, y, a, b ∈ {0,1}
- **Question distribution**: Uniform across (x, y)
- **Winning condition**:
  - (0,0), (0,1), (1,0): win if `a = b`
  - (1,1): win if `a ≠ b`

## 🧠 Classical Strategy

- **Deterministic limit**: Any classical strategy can win at most 3 out of 4 question pairs.
- **Max classical win probability**: **75%**
- **Probabilistic strategies**: No improvement; average ≤ deterministic.

## ⚛ Quantum Strategy

### Shared Entangled State
- Alice and Bob share the **Bell state**:
|φ⁺⟩ = (|00⟩ + |11⟩) / √2

### Operations
- **Alice applies**:
- `U₀` if x=0
- `U_π/4` if x=1

- **Bob applies**:
- `U_π/8` if y=0
- `U_−π/8` if y=1

## 📊 Probability Calculations

For each (x, y) pair, the strategy yields a **win probability** of:

- (0,0): Pr(a = b) = (2 + √2) / 4
- (0,1): Pr(a = b) = (2 + √2) / 4
- (1,0): Pr(a = b) = (2 + √2) / 4
- (1,1): Pr(a ≠ b) = (2 + √2) / 4

### ✅ Final Result

- **Quantum win probability**: **~85%**
- **Classical limit**: **75%**
- **Quantum advantage**: **10%**

This matches the **Tsirelson bound**, the theoretical maximum quantum value.


## 🔍 Geometric Interpretation

- Winning probability governed by:
Pr(a = b) = cos²(α − β)
Pr(a ≠ b) = sin²(α − β)

- **Alice’s measurement angles**: 0, π/4
- **Bob’s measurement angles**: π/8, −π/8

Optimal angles maximize quantum correlation for winning conditions.

## 🌍 Physical Significance

- **Demonstrates**: Incompatibility of quantum mechanics with local hidden variable theories.
- **Supports**: Bell’s theorem with experimental setups.
- **Recognized in Nobel Prize 2022**: Clauser, Aspect, Zeilinger for their work on Bell test experiments.
