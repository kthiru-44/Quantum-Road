# Quantum Algorithms (Qiskit)

Contains algorithm implementations and simulations using Qiskit.

| Algorithm | Description | Notes |
|------------|--------------|-------|
| CHSH Game | Demonstrates quantum nonlocality and Bell inequality violation. | Add noise comparison results. |
| Grover’s Algorithm | Quantum search algorithm showing √N speedup. | Compare simulator vs hardware. |
| Quantum Teleportation | Transfer of arbitrary qubit state via entanglement. | Include Bloch sphere visualization. |
| Deutsch-Jozsa | Distinguish constant vs balanced functions in one query. | Verify using Aer simulator. |
