Quantum Computing Journey

This repository documents my journey into Quantum Computing as an undergraduate student. It contains learning notes, small projects, and experiments as I build the foundations needed for a career in quantum information, algorithms, and quantum software engineering.

📂 Structure

Code Experiments – Python and Qiskit implementations of quantum gates, circuits, and algorithms.

Mini Projects – Applications of quantum concepts (e.g., CHSH game, quantum teleportation, Grover’s algorithm).

Resources – Links to references, papers, and textbooks I’m following.

🎯 Current Focus

Exploring Qiskit simulators (Aer) and running small quantum experiments.

🚀 Roadmap

Year 1–2: Build strong foundations in Python, math, and quantum basics.

Year 2 Internship: Apply for research internships.

Year 3–4: Explore advanced quantum algorithms, quantum ML, and industry-focused projects.

Post-BTech: Pursue a Master’s abroad in Quantum Computing / Quantum Technology (NUS, UMD, ETH).

🛠️ Tools

Languages: Python

Frameworks: Qiskit, PennyLane, Cirq, QuTiP

Environment: Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm

📌 Goals

Build a personal foundation in quantum algorithms and information theory.

Prepare for industry roles in quantum software after a Master's.

👉 This repo is a living notebook — it will grow as I learn, experiment, and build.
